# Rezon Merch
Rezon Store Application project

A collaborative mobile programming project aimed at developing an original online store
to test and explore features of 3D files and integration that will allow users to 
interact with a model of any product by rotating and resizing through a built-in viewer.
It will be devleoped using Flutter and Dart to run on both Android and Web platforms. 

By the end of the project, the team will deliver a fully functional prototype of a digital
merchandise store for a custom brand named Rezon. The application will allow users to create accounts,
browse and view products in interactive 3D, add items to a cart, and complete a simulated purchase process.
